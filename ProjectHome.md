The files in this project allow you to run the Weltmeister level editor on IIS/ASP.NET (instead of Apache/PHP).

To use these files, you should have a Windows machine running either XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003 or Server 2008. You should also have IIS installed and running, as well as the .NET framework 2.0 or above.

See the README file or the Wiki pages for instructions on how to get this working in your IIS installation.
