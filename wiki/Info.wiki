#summary Background on the ImpactJS IIS Backend Project

ImpactJS is a kick-ass JavaScript/HTML5 game engine that uses the canvas
element and underlying drawing api. It unfortunately depends on the developer
having Apache & PHP installed on their machine to use the built-in level editor
(Weltmeister).

If you're running Windows and doing HTML5 game development, you most likely
already have IIS (and the .NET framework) installed. The files in this package
allow you to run ImpactJS and the Weltmeister editor in IIS, eliminating the need
to download, install and configure apache and PHP.
